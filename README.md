# Spinning Geometries in Terminal

Do you want to see mesmerizing spinning 3D geometries in your terminal? Look no further! This program will generated and animate various shapes, such as cubes, spheres, donuts, and cylinders, using ASCII characters.

Get ready to be hypnotized by the shapes as they spin endlessly in your terminal window. Who needs fancy graphics when you have ASCII art?

## Getting started

To get started with the program, simply download the source code from this repository and run the executable. You can choose from different shape implementations, such as donut.rs and cylinder.rs, to see different shapes in action. You can also modify the source code and create your own custom shapes!

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues. We welcome any and all contributions, from bug fixes to new shapes to add to the program.

Let's make the world a more mesmerizing place, one spinning geometry at a time!

**Disclaimer**: Do not operate heavy machinery while mesmerized by the spinning shapes. And please, no spinning while driving.
